# Robotics Modeling and Control Projects
Graduate-level robotics projects in modeling, control, and trajectory planning using MATLAB.


This repository contains four MATLAB-based robotics projects covering kinematics, dynamics, and control of robotic manipulators. The projects progress from inverse kinematics modeling to full dynamic simulation and trajectory tracking control.

## Project Overview

### Project 1: 2D and 3D Inverse Kinematics
Implements inverse kinematics solutions for both 2D and 3D robotic manipulators, focusing on position analysis and joint configuration determination.

### Project 2: 6-DOF Inverse Kinematics Using DH Parameters
Models a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator using standard Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. Forward kinematics are computed and inverse kinematics are solved numerically using optimization techniques.

### Project 3: 2-DOF Planar Manipulator Dynamics
Derives and simulates the forward dynamics of a 2-link planar manipulator using Euler–Lagrange formulation. The project includes numerical simulation and animation of robot motion.

### Project 4: 2-DOF Planar Manipulator Control (Figure-8 Tracking)
Designs and compares joint-space and Cartesian-space PD controllers to track a figure-8 trajectory. Includes full dynamic modeling, Jacobian-based control, and trajectory generation.
